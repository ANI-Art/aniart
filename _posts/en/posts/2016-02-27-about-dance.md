Expressionism is all about emotions, about feelings sharing by implicit visualizations of reality. 

One of my recent paintings “Dance” is my experiment with texture, composition and color variances. I wanted to communicate all those feelings of ethereality and late Spring and amorousness inspired by blooming lilac under my window.
