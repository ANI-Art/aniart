This painting was created by request of my friend Olga Yakovleva, who proposed the idea.

The plot of this painting was inspired by the painting ['All at Once'](http://www.stankakordic.com/paint/allatonce) by Stanka Kordic. She said she wanted to see this plot everyday, but a bit different one - more heartful, more cozy. I tried to put both of this feelings into this painting. And so my friend is happy, and I feel fullfillment about the new experience.
