I want to invite You to participate in the auction which will be hold during the charity event “Astrodata’s White Ball”. I’m going to place on auction two my paintings “Sunrise” and “Moon”. 

Funds raised during the event will go for Aidan’s treatment, the small boy with diagnose cerebral paralysis. The event will take place on January, 23. More details you can find [here](http://astrodata.pro/arhiv/5128).
