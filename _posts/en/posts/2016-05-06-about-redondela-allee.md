This place is situated in the small town in Spain called Redondela. This allee is very beautiful and shady and go along the town center. And the town was one of many we stayed during mine and my husband's [Camino de Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago). In fact, you can find more information about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redondela).
