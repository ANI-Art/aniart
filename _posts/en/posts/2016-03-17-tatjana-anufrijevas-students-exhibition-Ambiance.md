Glad to let you know about the opening of the exhibition “Ambiance”, where you can see my new paintings among the other works of art by Tatjana Anufrijeva’s students. Painting can be a beautiful feelings cocktail. Mixing colors to create an ambiance is our way of creation.

The exhibition will take place in [“Style Beat City Art Club”](https://www.facebook.com/StyleBeatCity/) from April 2 to April 30. Opening hours: from Tuesday till Friday - from 12:00 to 20:00, from 12:00 to 18:00 on Saturday.
